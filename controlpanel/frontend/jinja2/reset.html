    <p>Even the best curated home directories can get into a bad
    state (for example, a broken conda environment or Jupyter and RStudio won't
    start).</p>

    <p>Reset your home directory to recreate your conda environment and shell
    settings to a clean state. Technical details of this process can be
    <a href="">found here</a>.</p>

    <p>Please ensure you've copied any important files from your home directory
    (note: <strong>important files should be stored in S3 or GitHub</strong>).</p>

    <p>This process will take several minutes to complete.</p>
