      <p class="govuk-body-l">We're planning some changes to how you log into the Analytical Platform. We are transitioning from using GitHub to your Microsoft email (<code>@justice.gov.uk</code>, <code>@publicguardian.gov.uk</code>, etc).</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">For now all you need to do is click the button below to authenticate via Microsoft 365. This is a one-time operation which will link your current Analytical Platform account information to your Microsoft email address. This means you'll keep all your current permissions, and there's nothing extra you need to do.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You will continue to log in to the Control Panel via your GitHub account as usual for now. You can read further information about these changes in the <a href="https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C4PF7QAJZ/p1712592546423129">#analytical-platform-support</a> Slack channel.</p>
