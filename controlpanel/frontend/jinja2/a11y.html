    <p>This accessibility statement applies to the Ministry of Justice's
    Analytical Platform.</p>

    <p>This service is run by Analytical Platform Team of the Ministry of
    Justice. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this service.
    For example, on the Control Panel website (this website) you
    should be able to:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
      <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
      <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
      <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the
      most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We've also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>
